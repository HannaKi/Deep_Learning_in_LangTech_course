    "#### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "As was previously discussed, when we are bulding a bag of words - classifier, our input is a set of unordered words and the output is a single label. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list of words is given to the model as a feature vector, a single numerical vector. So, to repeat its input is a single vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this transformation, all tokens need to have a numerical identification. That is, each word is associated with a specific number. In practice this is retrieved from a vocabulary as was shown before.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Its output is a label. As such it is a function from a vector into a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labels are typically represented as a vector, which has a value for all possible labels, or a single value if the task is binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Seq2Label differs from this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference from the bow is the form of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the bow example, the input is a single vector, but instead of representing a set, it represents a sequence. This is achieved simply by adding the token identifiers after each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is identical.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What's good about convolution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional networks are fast. They are fast because they are easily parallelizable. That is because no part of the convolution output depends on another one of the outputs. If that was the case, as it is in recurrent neural networks we couldn't make predictions before other parts of the layer have finished calculating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1-dimensional convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "During he earlier lecture and also to a large degree on the internet, image classification is used to demonstrate conv-nets. That is very understandable, for that is the area in which these networks traditionally shine and also because the convolution operation is a traditional tool for image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "An image is a two dimensional input. It has height and it has width. A sequence of words has only one dimension. That is, you can traverse it forwards and backwards, but there is no traversing it \"up\" or \"down\" nor is there \"toward\" and \"from\" etc. It just is a one-dimensional sequence of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, the convolution operation applied to text is usally one dimensional, instead of two dimensional convolution often applied to images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant variables in the operation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Kernel size, in effect how many conv operations are applied to the input\n",
    "2. Filter size, in effect how wide the applied conv operations are\n",
    "3. Stride length\n",
    "4. Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input / Output\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation takes as its input 2-d matrices (when we discount the batch_size). The matrix is in the shape of (steps, input_dim)\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation returns similarly a 2-d matrix. The size of the output matrix is (new_steps, filters). In this shape filters corresponds to the amount of filters. The new step count is a little bit trickier. It depends on stride length, kernel size and used padding style. \n",
