# How to attend the course

* We expect you to **take notes during the lecture**, the online materials support, but not replace lectures. It is highly unlikely you can pass the course by simply reading through the online materials.
* If you cannot make it to a lecture, find a friend who can share their notes with you.

# Computers and accounts

* The course takes place in the linux classroom. You will receive user accounts and passwords during the first demo session.
* Coursework will happen on the remote server **vm0964.kaj.pouta.csc.fi**, you will receive user accounts and passwords during the first demo session. You can also access this server from home using **ssh** (on linux/Mac) and **putty ssh** (windows).
* See [running_code.ipynb](running_code.ipynb) for details on the various machines
